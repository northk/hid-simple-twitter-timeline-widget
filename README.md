hid-simple-twitter-timeline-widget
==================================

**hid-simple-twitter-timeline-widget** is a WordPress widget that displays a Twitter public timeline. There are many good Twitter timeline plugins available at WordPress.org, but I wanted a very simple one. The WordPress widget embeds a standard Twitter timeline widget via JavaScript. 

To use it, first login to your Twitter account and build a standard embedded Twitter timeline widget on your Twitter widget settings page (see [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines)).

Then copy the 'hid-simple-twitter-timeline-widget' folder into wp-content/plugins. Next activate the plug-in, in the WordPress control panel. Next, drag and drop the widget into a widget area of your theme in appearance->widgets.

Finally, configure the widget by entering a widget title, the numeric widget ID from your Twitter widget settings page, and the number of tweets you want to display (1 to 20).
